List of things that have to be completed:

TODO: Check forwarding from load to the data input of a store (i.e.,
register rt) without a stall cycle in between (in other words, a WB->MEM
forward from the load to the store)
TODO: All other cases of forwarding to a store should forward when the store is in the EX stage.
TODO: Forwarding to ID for the execution of branches. You may need to add stall
cycles between the forwarding instruction and the branch in ID for the
forwarding to work
TODO: one-cycle load-use stall, 
TODO: one-cycle arithmetic-branch stall, 
TODO: two-cycle load-branch stall
TODO: Check that dependencies on the zero register shouldnâ€™t cause a stall
TODO: figure out what info.isVAlid should be used for
